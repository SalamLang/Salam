## Code Style and Guidelines

To maintain consistency and readability, please follow these coding conventions when contributing code:

- Use clear and descriptive variable names, function names, and comments.
- Write meaningful commit messages that explain the purpose of each commit.
- Keep your changes focused and atomic. Avoid mixing unrelated changes in the same pull request.
- Test your code thoroughly to ensure its functionality and prevent regressions.

### Formatting Tools

To help maintain consistent code quality, we use the following formatting and linting tools:

- **clang-format**: We use `clang-format` to ensure consistent formatting for C/C++ files. Please run `clang-format` before submitting a pull request. You can configure your editor to do this automatically.

  To format your code using `clang-format`:

  ```bash
  clang-format -i <your-file>
  ```

- **clang-tidy**: Use `clang-tidy` to catch common errors, style issues, and potential bugs. It's recommended to run `clang-tidy` as part of your workflow.

  To run `clang-tidy`:

  ```bash
  clang-tidy <your-file>
  ```

- **Other Tools**: You may also use additional linting or static analysis tools, such as `cppcheck` or `valgrind`, to improve the efficiency and correctness of the code.

### Commit Hooks

We recommend using Git hooks or pre-commit hooks to automatically run formatters or linters before each commit. You can set this up with the following steps:

1. Install `pre-commit`:

   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   ```

2. Set up the hooks:

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```
