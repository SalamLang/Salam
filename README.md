# Salam Language: The Salam Programming Language

Salam Language, inspired by the Persian and Arabic roots of the word `salam`, which means `peace`, is a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) crafted for simplicity and accessibility within the Iranian, Persian-speaking, and Arabic-speaking communities. Serving as the first Persian and Arabic programming language, Salam Language is designed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience, specifically tailored for users, students, and developers familiar with Persian or Arabic. Embracing the cultural and linguistic richness of the region, Salam Language aims to empower a diverse range of individuals, making programming more approachable and fostering a sense of ease and collaboration in the local coding community.
